// The actual arrangement of the LEDs connected to this Teensy 3.0 board.
// LED_HEIGHT *must* be a multiple of 8.  When 16, 24, 32 are used, each
// strip spans 2, 3, 4 rows.  LED_LAYOUT indicates the direction the strips
// are arranged.  If 0, each strip begins on the left for its first row,
// then goes right to left for its second row, then left to right,
// zig-zagging for each successive row.
#define LED_WIDTH      240   // number of LEDs horizontally
#define LED_HEIGHT     8   // number of LEDs vertically (must be multiple of 8)
#define LED_LAYOUT     0    // 0 = even rows left->right, 1 = even rows right->left

// The portion of the video image to show on this set of LEDs.  All 4 numbers
// are percentages, from 0 to 100.  For a large LED installation with many
// Teensy 3.0 boards driving groups of LEDs, these parameters allow you to
// program each Teensy to tell the video application which portion of the
// video it displays.  By reading these numbers, the video application can
// automatically configure itself, regardless of which serial port COM number
// or device names are assigned to each Teensy 3.0 by your operating system.
#define VIDEO_XOFFSET  0
#define VIDEO_YOFFSET  0       // display entire image
#define VIDEO_WIDTH    100

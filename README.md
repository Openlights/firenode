Firelight UDP->USB bridge


Dependencies
------------

Qt4
QtSerialPort (http://qt-project.org/wiki/QtSerialPort)


Building on Linux
-----------------

qmake
make

I have tested using VS2008 and the Qt4 VS plugin.  With this setup, you can just open the vcproj file and build.
Other configurations are usable at your own risk.
